        <p> I am from Lordsburg, NM where I lived my whole life and came to NMSU after I graduated high school in 2016. I have 2 little brothers one brother is in high school and the other is going to the Navy. I also have a little sister who also goes to
            NMSU. In September 2019, my fianc√® and myself had our daughter. After college graduation, I will be moving to Tucson, AZ to work for Raytheon. I got this job from going to the career fair Last Fall semester (2019). I am very excited to see
            what the future holds.</p>
