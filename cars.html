        <p> I have always had a passion for cars, pictured is my dream car, an S14 Kouki Nissan 240sx. I would love to build a clean daily 240sx but it is hard to find them because majority are used for drift builds. My dad and I are working on two 1968 camaros
            that we have in our garage, we have been slowly accumulating parts for the past couple years to finish them up. One for me and the other for my little brother. Camaros are my favorite classic muscle car. I always hope to one day own a Tesla
            Model 3 or S, I love how they are a perfect combination of software and vehicle. </p>
